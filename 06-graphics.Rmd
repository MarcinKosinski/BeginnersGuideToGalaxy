# Graphics

What would be our work value without visualisation? Not much. **R** provides use with some tools to make plots, charst and other visual stuff. However base version has very limited graphic design by default and making it pretty needs a lot of time and code. Nowadays, however, in `tidyverse` there is a very powerfull library with dozens of extensions - `ggplot2`. *GG* stands for *Gramar of Graphics* and in parctice it means that we build our visualisation layer after layer. The vast spectrum of `ggplot` functions and its extensions is out of the scope of this book. Here we will focus on the basic and most useful things as well as how to find not so common functionalities.
