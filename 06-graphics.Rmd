# Graphics

What would be our work value without visualisation? Not much. **R** provides use with some tools to make plots, charst and other visual stuff. However base version has very limited graphic design by default and making it pretty needs a lot of time and code. Nowadays, however, in `tidyverse` there is a very powerfull library with dozens of extensions - `ggplot2`. *GG* stands for *Gramar of Graphics* and in parctice it means that we build our visualisation layer after layer.
