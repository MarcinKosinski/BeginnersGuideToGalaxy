# Graphics

What would be our work value without visualization? Not much. **R** provides use with some tools to make plots, charts and other visual stuff. However base version has very limited graphic design by default and making it pretty needs a lot of time and code. Nowadays, however, in `tidyverse` there is a very powerful library with dozens of extensions - `ggplot2`. *GG* stands for *Gramar of Graphics* and in practice it means that we build our visualization layer after layer. The vast spectrum of `ggplot` functions and its extensions is out of the scope of this book. Here we will focus on the basic and most useful things as well as how to find not so common functionalists.
