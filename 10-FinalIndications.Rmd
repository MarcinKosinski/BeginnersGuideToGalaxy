# Final indications

## Use Projects
To organize your work, not only in **RStudio**, but also on hard drive you should use projects. It is extremly easy in this IDE. Just click button -- *Create new project* -- choose *New Directory* and type of project you need. **RStudio** will take care of everything for you. Later you can easily add files of subfolders with specifing content into your project and use ralational links.

## Use RMarkodow
To make your work more reproductible, and also to make nice looking output (in html or pdf) it is a good idea to work in RMarkdown files instead of RScripts. The syntax of **RMarkdown** is nearly identical to original **Markdown**, but allows you to execute and store **RCode**. You can find [RMarkdown introduction here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html). There is also nice [cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) which contains all commands you will need. As there is strong pressure to make reasearch and science more open and reproductible, it is strongly adviced that you work with proper tools to do it like **RMarkdown** or **Project Jupyter**. If you want to learn more, there is very nice [guide by British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/guide-to-reproducible-code.pdf) you should read.

## Use .rds files

Usually we work with plain text files like csv or tsv in **R**. Howevere, there is also a highly valuable format of files caled rds, that makes work even more pleasant. It not only preserves all classes of variables, but also takes less space than plain text file, due to compression algorithms. Also when using `saveRDS()` you don't need to define hundrets of parameters, just name of object you want to save and its file name. The downside is that it is format to use directly with R.
